#F0_duration_female_batch  July 3, 2003 
#Does batch processing of file duration and F0 statistics for adult female voice
#This script works all .wav files within a specified directory. The input must be a file which consists only of a vowel whose duration, 
# pitch and formants are to be measured. The pitch and formant analysis settings are for an adult female voice.

#For each file processed, the script returns one line of these ordered values to file pitch.txt: filename, duration of the file, mean F0, standard deviation of F0, maximum F0, 
# minimum F0, the range in F0 (max - min), the time of max F0 normalised as proportion of file length, the time of min F0 
# normalised as proportion of file length, the timepoint in seconds for max F0, the timepoint in seconds for min F0, the time 
# in seconds 25 ms after start of file, the time in seconds at midpoint, the time in seconds 25 ms before end of file,
# F0 estimate at 25 ms into file, F0 estimate at midpoint, F0 estimate at 25 ms before end of file.

#For each file processed, the script returns these ordered values to file formant.txt: filename, mean F1, mean F2, mean F3
# F1 at startpoint, F1 at midpoint, F1 at endpoint, F2 at startpoint, F2 at midpoint, F2 at endpoint, F3 at startpoint, F3 at
# midpoint, F3 at endpoint.


# In all values output, F0 and formants are expressed to nearest Hz, and time is in seconds (to nearest ms).
